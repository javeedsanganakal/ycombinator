# Claude Code Best Practices

Guidance for using Claude Code effectively and understanding its design philosophy, based on insights from Boris Cherny, the creator of Claude Code.

## Core Philosophy

### Build for T+6 Months

Design and configure for the model six months from now, not today's limitations:

- Avoid over-engineering workarounds for current model weaknesses
- Expect model improvements to obsolete most scaffolding code
- Treat compensatory instructions in CLAUDE.md as temporary

### Blatant Demand Principle

Only optimize behaviors users already perform:

- Observe what you do manually and repeatedly
- Make existing workflows easier, don't invent new ones
- If you're not already doing something manually, Claude Code won't magically make you do it

### Scaffolding is Tech Debt

All code and configuration compensating for model limitations is temporary:

- Expect to delete or rewrite within 6 months
- Don't over-invest in workarounds
- Model improvements typically provide 10-20% gains that obsolete previous scaffolding

## CLAUDE.md Configuration

### Keep It Minimal

```markdown
# Project: [Name]

## Context
[One paragraph describing what this project does]

## Key Patterns
- [Pattern 1]: [Brief explanation]
- [Pattern 2]: [Brief explanation]

## Preventable Mistakes
- [Mistake to avoid]
- [Another mistake to avoid]

## Commands
- Build: `[command]`
- Test: `[command]`
- Deploy: `[command]`
```

### When to Delete and Start Fresh

Delete CLAUDE.md and restart when:

- File exceeds ~500 lines
- Instructions contradict each other
- Many instructions address obsolete model limitations
- You notice Claude ignoring parts of the file

### What to Add Immediately

Add to CLAUDE.md when you notice:

- Repeated mistakes in PR reviews
- Project-specific conventions Claude keeps missing
- Build or test commands that require explanation

### What to Avoid

Do not add:

- General coding best practices (Claude already knows these)
- Verbose explanations of obvious patterns
- Instructions for problems that newer models handle automatically

## Plan Mode

### What It Is

Plan mode is a single prompt instruction that prevents Claude from writing code immediately:

```
Please think through this problem step by step without writing code yet.
```

### When to Use Plan Mode

Use for approximately 80% of sessions, especially:

- Complex tasks with multiple components
- Tasks requiring architectural decisions
- Debugging sessions where root cause is unclear
- Unfamiliar codebases or domains

### When to Skip Plan Mode

Skip for:

- Trivial changes (typo fixes, simple renames)
- Well-defined tasks with clear implementation
- Follow-up work where plan already exists

### Implementing Automatic Plan Mode

Add to CLAUDE.md for complex projects:

```markdown
## Default Behavior
For any task involving more than a single file change, start by outlining the approach before writing code.
```

## Sub-Agent Workflows

### Calibrating Agent Count

Match parallelism to task difficulty:

| Task Type | Agents | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Simple lookup | 1 | "What does this function do?" |
| Moderate research | 3-5 | "Find all usages of this API" |
| Complex debugging | 5-10 | "Why is this test flaky?" |
| Broad codebase analysis | 10+ | "Audit all authentication flows" |

### Uncorrelated Context Windows

Sub-agents provide value through fresh, independent context:

- Each agent starts without pollution from other agents' reasoning
- Enables parallel exploration of different hypotheses
- Reduces anchoring bias from early incorrect conclusions

### Prompting Sub-Agents

The parent Claude instance (Mama Claude) spawns sub-agents with specific, focused prompts:

```
Investigate whether the database connection pool is exhausted during peak load.
Focus only on connection lifecycle and pool configuration.
Report findings without implementing fixes.
```

## Productivity Patterns

### Observed Gains

Anthropic engineers report 150% productivity improvement - unprecedented compared to typical developer tooling improvements of 2%.

### Maximizing Effectiveness

1. **Start sessions with context**: Brief project description before diving into tasks
2. **Iterate rapidly**: Prototype 20 variations quickly instead of 3 polished ones
3. **Let Claude explore**: Remove barriers rather than constraining to predefined APIs
4. **Review output critically**: Productivity gains come from faster iteration, not blind acceptance

### Common Anti-Patterns

Avoid these behaviors that reduce effectiveness:

- Over-specifying implementation details in prompts
- Interrupting Claude mid-task with corrections
- Accumulating stale instructions in CLAUDE.md
- Fighting the model instead of working with its tendencies

## Building AI Coding Tools

### Product Overhang

Model capabilities often exist before products harness them:

- Observe what the model tries to do naturally
- Remove barriers to those behaviors
- Build interfaces that expose existing capabilities

### The Bitter Lesson Applied

More general approaches beat specialized ones:

- Don't over-engineer for specific edge cases
- Trust model improvements to handle current weaknesses
- Avoid betting against improving model capabilities

### Rapid Prototyping

When building features:

1. Build minimal version in hours, not days
2. Get to users immediately
3. Observe actual usage patterns
4. Iterate based on real feedback

Example: Plan mode shipped in 30 minutes after observing user patterns.

## Workflow: Starting a New Coding Session

1. **Assess task complexity**
   - Trivial: Skip to step 4
   - Moderate to complex: Continue to step 2

2. **Enter plan mode**
   - Describe the task clearly
   - Ask Claude to outline approach before coding
   - Review and refine the plan

3. **Decide on parallelism**
   - Single-focus task: Proceed with one context
   - Research/debugging: Spawn appropriate sub-agents

4. **Execute with iteration**
   - Let Claude work through the plan
   - Provide feedback on output
   - Iterate until complete

5. **Capture learnings**
   - Add preventable mistakes to CLAUDE.md
   - Remove obsolete instructions
   - Note patterns for future sessions

## Workflow: Maintaining CLAUDE.md

1. **Weekly review**
   - Scan for instructions no longer needed
   - Check for contradictions
   - Verify commands are current

2. **Post-PR review**
   - Add any repeated mistakes immediately
   - Update patterns that Claude missed

3. **Monthly reset evaluation**
   - If file exceeds 500 lines, consider fresh start
   - Archive old version for reference
   - Rebuild with only essential instructions

## Key Predictions and Context

Based on Claude Code's development trajectory:

- Terminal interface continues to work despite being "accidental"
- GUI versions (Claude Code Work) extend capability to non-technical users
- Expect significant capability improvements every 3-6 months
- Most valuable engineering skills shifting to product sense and user research

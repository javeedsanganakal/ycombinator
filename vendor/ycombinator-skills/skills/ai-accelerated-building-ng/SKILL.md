# Andrew Ng: Building Faster with AI

Guidance for applying Andrew Ng's principles on startup execution speed and AI-accelerated development, based on AI Fund's experience building approximately one startup per month.

## Core Thesis

**Execution speed is the strongest predictor of startup success.** AI coding tools enable 10x faster prototyping, shifting bottlenecks from implementation to product management and user feedback.

## AI Stack Layers

Understand where opportunities exist in the AI technology stack:

```
Layer 5: Applications        ← Biggest opportunities (must generate revenue for all layers below)
Layer 4: Orchestration       ← New layer enabling easier app building (agentic coordination)
Layer 3: Foundation Models   ← High PR/hype but dependent on app layer revenue
Layer 2: Cloud Infrastructure
Layer 1: Semiconductors
```

**Key insight:** Media focuses on technology layers, but by definition, the application layer must generate the most value to sustain the entire stack.

## Agentic AI Workflows

### Why Agentic Approaches Matter

Traditional LLM usage forces linear generation (first word to last, no backspace). Humans don't write well this way—neither does AI.

**Agentic workflow pattern:**
1. Generate outline/plan
2. Conduct research (web fetches, document retrieval)
3. Write first draft
4. Self-critique the draft
5. Revise based on critique
6. Iterate until quality threshold met

This iterative loop is slower but produces dramatically better results.

### When to Use Agentic Workflows

Apply agentic approaches for:
- Complex compliance document analysis
- Medical diagnosis reasoning
- Legal document interpretation
- Any task requiring research + synthesis + revision

## Startup Execution Speed Principles

### Speed as Success Predictor

High-velocity execution correlates with startup success. AI Fund observes this across their portfolio of monthly startup launches.

### AI-Enabled Acceleration

Current AI coding tools enable approximately **10x faster prototyping**:
- Rapid MVP development
- Faster iteration cycles
- Reduced time from idea to testable product

### Shifted Bottlenecks

When implementation accelerates 10x, new bottlenecks emerge:
1. **Product management decisions** - What to build becomes more important than how fast you can build
2. **User feedback collection** - Getting real user input becomes the limiting factor
3. **Idea validation** - Testing concrete ideas matters more than coding speed

### Best Practices for Speed

1. **Start with concrete ideas** - Vague concepts slow execution; specific features accelerate it
2. **Use AI coding assistants** - Leverage tools for rapid prototyping
3. **Iterate in 2-3 month cycles** - Best practices change frequently; stay current
4. **Focus on customer conversations** - Speed includes talking to users, not just writing code
5. **Design features and pricing early** - AI Fund teams do this alongside coding

## Evaluating AI Startup Opportunities

### Application Layer Focus

When evaluating where to build:

| Layer | Opportunity Size | Competition | Barrier |
|-------|------------------|-------------|---------|
| Applications | Largest by definition | Growing | Domain expertise |
| Orchestration | Medium, emerging | Moderate | Technical depth |
| Foundation Models | Large but concentrated | Intense | Capital-intensive |

### Opportunity Identification Framework

1. **Find existing workflows** that can be improved with agentic AI
2. **Identify domains** where iterative reasoning adds significant value
3. **Look for tasks** currently requiring expensive human expertise
4. **Target applications** that can generate revenue to justify AI costs

### Validated Use Cases from AI Fund

Domains where agentic workflows have proven valuable:
- Compliance document processing
- Medical diagnosis support
- Legal document reasoning
- Any domain requiring research → synthesis → revision

## Quick Reference: Building Faster

### Before Starting a Project

- [ ] Define concrete, specific features (not vague concepts)
- [ ] Identify the workflow to implement or improve
- [ ] Determine if agentic approach is needed (complex reasoning, research, revision)
- [ ] Set up AI coding assistant for rapid prototyping

### During Development

- [ ] Use iterative agentic loops for quality-critical outputs
- [ ] Prototype quickly, then gather user feedback
- [ ] Let product decisions (not coding speed) drive priorities
- [ ] Revisit approach every 2-3 months as tools improve

### Evaluating Progress

- [ ] Measure execution velocity, not just output quality
- [ ] Track time from idea to testable prototype
- [ ] Monitor where bottlenecks actually occur
- [ ] Adjust based on real user feedback, not assumptions
